# Tech Skills

üèóÔ∏è **Work in progress!** üèóÔ∏è

After my graduation from university, I already earned the basic overview of the vast IT landscape. I touched various programming languages, from C, C++ to Java or Python. I gained foundamental familiarity with computer related subjects like operating systems, internet layers and protocols, relational databases, website development, alghoritms, machine learning, computer graphics and mathematics. With such baggage, I started my iOS developer journey.

During last 4 years of commercial work I went through the full iOS development process and experienced different aspects of it. Starting with solving the bugs and learning the basics like GIT tools or Xcode, I gradually witnessed more and more various programming paradigms, architectures and patterns. From classic MVC and other bi-directional architectures like MVVM, MVVM+C to a more unidirectional VIP cycle based CLEAN or even reactive arhitectures like TCA.
