# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Tech Skills

After my graduation from university, I already had the basic overview of the vast IT landscape. I touched various programming languages, from C, C++ to Java or Python. I gained foundamental familiarity with computer related subjects like operating systems, internet layers and protocols, relational databases, website development, alghoritms, machine learning, computer graphics and mathematics. With such baggage, I started my iOS developer journey.

During last 4 years of commercial work I went through the full iOS development process and experienced different aspects of it. Starting with solving simple bugs and learning the basics like GIT tools or Xcode, I gradually witnessed more and more various programming paradigms, architectures and patterns. From classic MVC and other bi-directional architectures like MVVM, MVVM+C to a more unidirectional VIP cycle based CLEAN or even reactive arhitectures like TCA.

With each new team, I learned better and better solutions and practices. I learned how to work within Agile-oriented methodologies like Scrum or Kanban using tools like Jira to boost the productivity. I went throught the whole app release process and learned ways to automate the cycle CI/CD pipelines. I have experienced few non-testable projects in my past and I know why testing matters. These days testing is a must have for me, and I shift towards Test Driven Development wherever applicable. 

These days I want to keep close to my roots, which are deep in Swift and iOS development, but I also want to take a look around be explore further hybrid approaches like Flutter or serverside backend development.
